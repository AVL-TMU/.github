## 🏁 Overview
The Autonomous Vehicles Laboratory (AVL) at TMU, led by Prof. Reza Faieghi, pushes the boundaries of provably safe autonomy for unmanned aerial and ground vehicles. We integrate state-of-the-art perception, motion planning, and control to build the next generation of autonomous systems.

## 🔬 Research Focus
- **Collision-Free Motion Control**  
  Real-time algorithms for safe navigation of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs).  
- **Perception & Mapping**  
  Vision-based SLAM, sensor fusion, and environment understanding.  
- **Hardware-Software Integration**  
  End-to-end drone design: airframes, avionics, PX4 Autopilot, and ROS.
